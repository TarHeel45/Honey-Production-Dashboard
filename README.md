# Honey Production Dashboard

This repository stores all of the work I did regarding a dashboard I built using Shiny R. I wanted to practice my data science skills in this project, but not in terms of learning algorithms or analysis methods, but in terms of data communication and visualization.  

You can find the data used in this project in the Data folder. I used a pre-cleaned dataset from Kaggle and also pulled some raw data from the NASS, which I then cleaned.  The R markdown file with the data cleaning and wrangling process is also in this repository. You can also find the actual script wherein the Shiny app is written.
